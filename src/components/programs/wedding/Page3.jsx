            Amazing grace (how sweet the sound) that saved a wretch like me! I
            was once lost, but now I&apos;m found, was blind, but now I see,
          </li>
          <li className={styles.pageList}>
            ‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fear

            Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come:

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      Dearly beloved, we are gathering together here in the presence of the
      Almighty God in Christ Jesus by the instrumentality of Holy Spirit, in the
      presence of His Angels and Ministers of His gospel as well as in the
      presence of this congregation of His children.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      We are gathered together to join this woman and this man in Holy
      Matrimony. Marriage is a holy and honorable state which God Himself
      founded and established in the Garden of Eden before the coming of sin
      into human life. Marriage is an estate of utmost importance and therefore
      must be treated with dignity and reverence.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      Jesus our Lord and Savior bestowed honor, reverence, dignity and His
      blessings on marriage by His personal presence at the wedding in Cana of
      Galilee as well as performing His first miracle there. The scriptures
      compare the union of husband and wife with the Holy and Mystic union which
      exists between Christ and His Church.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      That is these two, husband and wife will leave all others and cleave to
      each other becoming one flesh. In unity of soul and body, both will leave
      together as an inseparable pair, and helper fit for each other, and pray
      together as join theirs of the grace of eternal life in Christ Jesus, duly
      considering the causes for which marriage was ordained.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      <span className={styles.highlightSpan}>Firstly</span>, It was ordained for
      mutual societal help and comfort that one ought to have for each other.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      <span className={styles.highlightSpan}>Secondly</span>, It was ordained in
      order that the natural instincts and affections implanted by God to this
      holy estate should continue there in pureness of living.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      <span className={styles.highlightSpan}>Thirdly</span>, I was ordained for
      the increase of mankind according to the will of God and that children
      might be brought up in His fear and the nature of the Lord, and to the
      praise of His name.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.page3Para}>
      These people have come to be joined together into the holy estate of
      matrimony. Therefore if anyone among the congregation present here today
      knows of any just cause why they should not be joined together according
      to the word of God and the laws of the Land, let such a person say it now
      or forever hold his or her PEACE.
