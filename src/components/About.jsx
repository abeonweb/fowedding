        <p className={styles.text}>
          Folake and Wole met in 2004 while she was visiting her friend who lived
          nearby and happened to be Wole&apos;s cousin, Seun. Even though they became friends, there was no interest beyond
          that.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Wole, a shy guy, while Folake is quite chatty, they often crossed
          paths because they had mutual friends. In fact, it turns out that Wole
          and Folake's cousin Sola are friends as well.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          While Folake went off to college in the United States, Wole went to
          Covenant University, and they lost touch for many years.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          10 years later, Folake returned to Nigeria, reconnected with her
          friends, and also ran into Wole. This time, they caught up and began
          talking more often, and then they hit it off. While they liked each
          other, he felt like he could not match her energy.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          Wole moved to Ibadan, where he got a job while Folake lived in Lagos.
          They lost touch again within that period.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          By 2020, Folake relocated to the US, and somehow, again, she and Wole
          reconnected. It seemed like the universe was doing its thing. This
          time, they began a long-distance relationship when they realised they
          had feelings for each other. Folake came home often just so she could
          be with Wole.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          By December 2022, Wole popped the big question, to which Folake
          said,'YES'! Hence, the reason why we are here.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          On the 11th & 13th of May 2023, we will join them to celebrate as they
          become man and wife.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          We wish them a blissful marriage and home in Jesus' name.
